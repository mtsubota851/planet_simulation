## General Info

In this programming project, the astronomers asked me to display the first four planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars)
to revolve around the sun.

The NASA staff asked me to also have an understanding of the physics in space, such as the law of attraction.

Through my knowledge of trigonometry, calculus, and unit conversion I was able to display a properly functioning
program for the stakeholders.

## Goals

To understand the rotation of the first four planets around the sun.
Calculate and display the distance to the Sun from each planet.

## Technologies

Project was created with:
* Python 3.7
* Sublime Text
